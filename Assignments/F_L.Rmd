# Big Picture 

Other people have said that the prevalence of civil war is due to the end of the Cold War, higher ethnic or religious diversity, or strong ethnic or political grievances.  

----

# This paper argues that this is not true.  

Their Hypotheses

* “We hypothesize that financially, organizationally, and politically weak central governments render insurgency more feasible and attractive due to weak local policing or inept and corrupt counterinsurgency practices…. On the rebel side, insurgency is favored by rough terrain, rebels with local knowledge of the population superior to the government’s, and a large population” (76).

* To test this, Fearon and Laitin develop 11 hypotheses that they test in five models using 127 civil wars across 54 years (1945-1999).
