Hey all,\[NonBreakingSpace]

In case you want to practice for your exam, you can try to replicate models \
from some other papers.\[NonBreakingSpace]

You can try replicating the tables 1 and 2 in section B of the supplemental \
materials from Hanmer and Kalkan\[CloseCurlyQuote]s paper. Here is the data, \
and here are the supplemental materials

That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s an example we worked on in class. If you want to try \
a paper you haven\[CloseCurlyQuote]t seen before, you can try to replicate \
table 1 (columns 2 and 3) from\[NonBreakingSpace]Rogowski 2013
\[NonBreakingSpace](Links to an external site.)
, and then try to produce some predicted probabilities.

. To run the models in R you need to specify that the race variable is a \
factor and include controls for the country. This \
R-code\[NonBreakingSpace]shows how you would run both models in R. Keep in \
mind you will also need to show predicted probabilities on your exam. You \
might be better off using the obsval command instead of glm.\[NonBreakingSpace]

Important note: you should get similar coefficients to Rogowski, but you will \
have different standard errors unless you cluster. You can ignore that for \
now, your coefficient estimates should be very close to the ones in the table.
